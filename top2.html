        <p>It is a flat, windy and desert-like island and is on the southern fringes of the hurricane belt and NOT outside the hurricane belt as commonly believed.  The main area of accommodations is along the west coast, where a series of high and low-rise hotels and casinos draw visitors from around the world.   Timeshares, condominiums and restaurants are gradually being developed inland from this west coast.  Aruba has more timeshares than any other island in the Caribbean and depends heavily on the tourist industry as almost everything has to be imported including fruit. The official languages are Dutch and Papiamento, but English, German and Spanish are widely spoken.  Most natives speak several languages.  Major chain resorts usually have staff speaking Dutch, English and German at a minimum.  Many expatriates have come to work in the tourist industry and often speak only their native language.</p>

        <div class="right" style="background-color:#6F1D1B;">Zion National Park, Utah
        <img src="images/zion.avif" height="500px" width="500px">
        <p>Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Hiking The Narrows is arguably the quintessential Zion experience. The Narrows can be hiked either as a top-down through-hike from Chamberlain Ranch to the Temple of Sinawava, or as an up-and-back bottom-up hike from the Temple of Sinawava. Hiking is done largely in the river as, for a third of the route, the river runs canyon wall to canyon wall. Water levels change from season to season; most hikers will wade at least waist-deep and many will swim a few short sections.</p></div>
